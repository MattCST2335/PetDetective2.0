FAQ. 
1) Question: Can the user run the program if any of the drop-down menus say "Pick an option..."?
Answer: No! The user must pick a valid option for every drop-down menu. The program simply will not run if any of the drop-down menus say "Pick an option...".
2) Question: Why do some of the options turn red when I go to search for a pet?
Answer: A valid option has not been chosen in one or more of the drop-down menus. The unselected options turn red.
3) Question: How do I exit the program?
Answer: A user may exit the program by clicking the exit button or by clicking on the red X in the top right corner of the window.
4) Question: How do I start over if I want to search for pets using a different set of criteria?
Answer: Simply Click on the reset button in the results page.
5) Question: Why did the results page tell me that no pets matched my criteria?
Answer: There are no pets that exist that match the selected options in the homepage. The user is trying to search for a type of pet that does not exist.
